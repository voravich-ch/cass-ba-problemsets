## **Problem Set 3**

**Task:** The problem set comprises one point only:

  1.   Use NumPy to implement the Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm.

**Context:** As you work on the problem, keep the below in mind:

- both real and synthetic network dataset could be used;
- in order to identify the most central edges, you are allowed to use the [`edge_betweenness_centrality`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.edge_betweenness_centrality.html#networkx.algorithms.centrality.edge_betweenness_centrality) algorithm that Nx implements. The intuition behind this index is 'the higher the proportion of the short paths that visit an edge, the more central the edge'.
