## **Problem Set 1**

**Context:** Consider the dataset used in Koop and Tobias, which concerns the relationship between schooling and wage at the individual level.

**Task:** Create a scatter diagram that illustrates the economic returns of schooling to a generalist audience with a taste for minimalism ― say, the readership of the New York Times.
