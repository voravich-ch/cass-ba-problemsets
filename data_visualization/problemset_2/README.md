## **Problem Set 2**

**Context:** Consider the dataset used in Koop and *Tobias, which concerns the relationship between schooling and wage at the individuallevel.

**Task:** Create a Matplotlib figure that illustrates:

the univariate distributions of the following variables: 'EDUC', 'LOGWAGE', 'ABILITY', 'MOTHERED', 'FATHERED', and 'SIBLINGS';
the bivariate distribution of any possible pair of the above-mentioned variables;
submissions should build on Matplotlib only (that is, I won't accept Seaborn code);
to do the job, you can use as many 'ax' as you want;
the figure should fit an A4 page, landscape layout;
the audience is 'Dr. Asimit' - the visualization has to be included in the final year dissertation BA students have to deliver.
