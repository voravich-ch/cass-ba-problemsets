## **Problem Set 3**

**Context:** Consider the dataset ['Impact of COVID-19 on worldwide aviation'](https://zenodo.org/record/4088202#.X5NaZXVKgio),
which concerns the impact of global pandemic on the airline industry.

**Task**: Create **ONE** Matplotlib figure that illustrates the effect of the global pandemic on the airline industry. There are no constraints about the dimensions to include in the figure â€• in other words, students are free to emphasize the aspects they find more interesting. However, the plot(s) included in the Matplotlib figure(s) must include the temporal dimension.
